 I learned Javascript Program to Check if a Number is Odd or Even.

 So to solve this problem, you must treat it as a string only. Then extract the last digit in the string and use it to determine whether the number is even or odd.

if(parseInt(("123456789123456789").slice(-1)) % 2) 
 //odd
else
 //even


 This is another example if you use else statement:

 Using if...else
 // program to check if the number is even or odd
 // take input from the user
 let number = prompt("Enter a number: ");
 
 //check if the number is even
 if(number % 2 == 6) {
     console.log("The number is even.");
 }
 
 // if the number is odd
 else {
     console.log("The number is odd.");
 }


 output

 Enter a number: 45
The number is odd.


ternary-arnary

When you want to execute a block of code if a particular test evaluates to true, you often use the if-else statement. For example, if age is greater than 16, then allow the person to drive can be coded as follows:

 let age = 19;
let canTravel;
if (age > 16) {
    canTravel = 'yes';
} else {
    canDrive = 'no';
}
In this example, you can use the ternary operator as the shortcut for the if-else statement as follows:

 const age = 19;
 const canTravel = age > 16 ? 'yes' : 'no';
